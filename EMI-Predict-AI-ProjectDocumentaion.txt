Problem Statement 

Build a comprehensive financial risk assessment platform that integrates machine 
learning models with MLflow experiment tracking to create an interactive web 
application for EMI prediction. 

Nowadays, people struggle to pay EMI due to poor financial planning and inadequate 
risk assessment. This project aims to solve this critical issue by providing data-driven 
insights for better loan decisions. 

The platform should deliver: 

●​ Dual ML problem solving: Classification (EMI eligibility) and Regression 
(maximum EMI amount) 

●​ Real-time financial risk assessment using 400,000 records 
●​ Advanced feature engineering from 22 financial and demographic variables 



●​ ML flow integration for model tracking and comparison 
●​ Streamlit Cloud deployment for production-ready access 
●​ Complete CRUD operations for financial data management 

 

Business Use Cases 

Financial Institutions 

●​ Automate loan approval processes and reduce manual underwriting time by 80% 
●​ Implement risk-based pricing strategies for different EMI scenarios 
●​ Real-time eligibility assessment for walk-in customers 

 

FinTech Companies 

●​ Instant EMI eligibility checks for digital lending platforms 
●​ Integration with mobile apps for pre-qualification services 
●​ Automated risk scoring for loan applications 

Banks and Credit Agencies 

●​ Data-driven loan amount recommendations based on financial capacity

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis 

●​ Analyze EMI eligibility distribution patterns across different lending scenarios 
●​ Study correlation between financial variables and loan approval rates 
●​ Investigate demographic patterns and risk factor relationships 
●​ Generate comprehensive statistical summaries and business insights 

Step 3: Feature Engineering 

●​ Create derived financial ratios (debt-to-income, expense-to-income, affordability 
ratios) 

●​ Generate risk scoring features based on credit history and employment stability 
●​ Apply categorical encoding and numerical feature scaling 
●​ Develop interaction features between key financial variables 

Step 4: Machine Learning Model Development

●​ Additional models: Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, or Gradient 
Boosting Classifier 

●​ Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC 
●​ Best performing classification model will be selected for final deployment 

Regression Models (Maximum EMI Amount Prediction) - Minimum 3 Models 
Required: 

●​ Linear Regression for baseline performance 
●​ Random Forest Regressor for ensemble-based predictions 
●​ XGBoost Regressor for advanced gradient boosting 
●​ Additional models: Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, or 

Gradient Boosting Regressor 
●​ Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, R-squared, and MAPE 
●​ Best performing regression model will be selected for final deployment 

Step 5: Model Selection and MLflow Integration 

●​ Train minimum 3 models each for classification and regression problems 
●​ Configure MLflow tracking server for organized experiment management 
●​ Log comprehensive model parameters, hyperparameters, and performance 

metrics for all models 
●​ Create systematic artifact storage for models, visualizations, and datasets 
●​ Compare model performance using MLflow experiment tracking dashboard 
●​ Select best performing models based on evaluation metrics for production 

deployment 
●​ Implement model registry for version control and selected model storage 

 

Step 6: Streamlit Application Development 

●​ Multi-page web application with intuitive user interface 
●​ Real-time prediction capabilities for both classification and regression 



●​ Interactive data exploration and visualization components 
●​ Model performance monitoring and MLflow integration dashboard 
●​ Administrative interface for data management operations 

Step 7: Cloud Deployment and Production 

●​ Deploy complete application on Streamlit Cloud platform 
●​ Implement responsive design for cross-platform accessibility 
●​ Configure automated deployment pipeline from GitHub repository 
●​ Ensure proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms
